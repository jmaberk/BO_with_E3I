# BO_with_E3I

NOTE: Code here is functional but activelty being commented and updated to make it easier to understand and use.


## System Requierments
This code requires python 2.7. It will need to be modified to work with later versions of python. It requires several standard python packages such as numpy, scipy, pickle, itertools, random, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, math, time, mpl_toolkits, and copy. The real world experiments require matlab engine (https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html) and Keras (https://keras.io/). Keras itself requires TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

We used the code on a windows 10 machine with matlab R2015b and a Theano-based Keras.

## Previous work
Some code, including the real-world functions, are taken from previous works by Vu et al. These can be found here:https://github.com/ntienvu/ICDM2017_FBO and here:https://github.com/ntienvu/ICDM2016_B3O

## Example code
A quick example of the code is shown in example.py. This shows the optimization of the two peak Gaussian mixture discussed in the paper.
